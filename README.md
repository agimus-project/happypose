Toolbox and trackers for object pose-estimation. Based on the work [CosyPose](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/cosypose) and [MegaPose](https://github.com/megapose6d/megapose6d). This directory is currently under development. Please refer to the [documentation](https://agimus-project.github.io/happypose/) for more details.


## Installation

We strongly suggest to install it in either a
[venv](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/venv.html) or a
[conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

### Example with conda

```
git clone --branch dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/agimus-project/happypose.git
cd happypose
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate happypose
pip install .
```

git clone --branch dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/agimus-project/happypose.git

### Install extras:

- `multiview`: installs cosypose c++ extension

Create data dir /somewhere/convenient. The dataset to store are quite large.
